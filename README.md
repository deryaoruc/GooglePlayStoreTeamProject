Analysis and visualization of GPS data

1) Plot the categories according to download time (try to see if they fit in one plot, if there are too many , make top10 or top20)

2) Top 5 downloaded apps (show to which category they belong to)
------------------------------

-  Look at only paid apps. Which are the highest paid categories (Game, Business...)? Plot Top 10 (one plot)

-  Find the apps with the smallest size (look at the "Size" column, you have to turn those values into integers to be able to sort them! Be careful K = kilobytes so 1000 bytes, and M = megabytes so 1 000 000, you have to prepare the column before you can sort it right.) From the apps with smallest download find those with most installs. Top 20. (Only one plot!) See if any category is prevalent among these top 20.

- From the paid apps. We want to see top 20 by revenue, in a table. (and see if there is any category prevalent)

- From the top 20 smallest apps we want to see grouped by category and plot the categories. + add pie chart of how many of them are paid.

these ones
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Find the % distribution of apps by review sentiment (Pie chart with positive, neutral , negative)

- From the column Sentiment use only the apps that have positive reviews. Find what % of them are paid and what are free. From the paid ones find the most prevalent category (Game, Business...). Are they similar to the categories from the previous question 2 weeks ago?
